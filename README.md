## 🎮 What Is a Final Fantasy XIV Cheat?

A **FFXIV cheat** is any third-party tool, bot, or memory injection that gives you advantages the game normally doesn’t allow — *like ESP*, *teleport hacks*, *fly hacks*, *infinite movement speed*, or *auto-rotation scripts*. It’s mostly used in PvE, farming, gathering, or exploration, since **FFXIV is server-side heavy** and has strict anti-cheat.
